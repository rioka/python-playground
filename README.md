Simple projects just to familiarise myself with Python ecosystem.

> The code in this sample projects is not supposed to use or suggest any best practice: I'm totally new to Python, so I assume this is close to the worst code you could possibly write.

## Content

- [step-01](./step-01): sample code setting up a virtual environment
- [step-02](./step-02): same code as [step-01](./step-01), just moving the code to load a page to a separate module
